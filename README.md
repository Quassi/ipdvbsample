Setup: Nokia Mediamaster 9500 connected with a SCSI-cable to the PC. 

Thanks to Dr. Overflow for the DVB2000 software, the creator of the MM9500 firmware to make this all possible! It was fun and instructive creating this piece together with you!

  This is Visual C++ 5.0 code, it'll show you how to handle with SCSI 
  and the 'orange' MAC screen.

  - OnInitDialog()    :  find the MediaMaster
  - OnButtonTofile()  :  init the 'orange' MAC-screen
  - OnButtonStop()    :  stop the MAC-screen

  - OnTimer()         :  poll the Mediamaster and get data into buf[]
